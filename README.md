# Probability-Walks-Ruin-to-Rewards

A collection of analytical derivations and Python implementations for the “Ruin to Returns” problems in MTL106: Probability and Stochastic Processes.

## Project Overview

This repository contains solutions to four core problems:

1. **Classical Gambler’s Ruin (Problem 1)**  
   - Hitting probabilities and expected stopping time for a biased random walk between 0 and N.

2. **Aggressive Betting Strategy (Problem 2)**  
   - Win‐probability and expected duration when betting all‐in below N/2 and the deficit above.

3. **Cursed Gambler with Wealth Cap (Problem 3)**  
   - Expected number of rounds until stopping, with a temporary cap at wealth m+W, output mod \(10^9+7\).

4. **Stock Price Markov Chain (Problem 4)**  
   - Stationary distribution, steady‐state expectation, and hitting‐time for a birth–death chain on \(\{0,\dots,N\}\).
